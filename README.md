# Shizz
Shizz is a comprehensive platform that aims to enhance the event experience by connecting people attending the same events or festivals and providing event organizers with tools to create engaging and interactive events.

# Problem
Many people attending events or festivals often face challenges such as finding companions to share travel costs, reducing the fear of attending events alone, and connecting with like-minded individuals at the event. Event organizers also struggle to engage participants and provide a platform for networking and interaction.

# Solution
Shizz addresses these challenges by offering two main products:

Event Matching and Companionship: Users can sign up and create profiles, specifying their interests and event preferences. The platform uses a matching algorithm to suggest potential companions based on shared interests and event attendance. Users can connect with their matches, discuss event details, plan travel arrangements, and share experiences.

Event Organization and Engagement: Organizations can create events on the platform, providing live information and updates about the event. Participants can engage in a global chat to discuss the event, ask questions, and share insights. Participants can also create custom groups and specify the features or personality of the group. An algorithm recommends participants for entry into custom groups based on their personality matching with the group's specified features. Recommended people can also be filtered based on location, allowing the group owner to sort people by distance according to their own location.

# Implementation
Shizz is built using a stack that includes Node.js and Express for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The platform utilizes Mongoose as an ORM for MongoDB and provides a responsive frontend using React for an enhanced user experience. The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, providing a seamless event experience for both participants and organizers.

# Features
User-friendly interface for easy event creation and management.
Real-time chat functionality for seamless communication.
